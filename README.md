# bloodcrave-crypt
The Crypt Management layer of our topdown, tactical turn-based game where a coven of vampires are pitted against shrewd vampire slayers within the confines of a large city. The vampires hide under the ground, using the sewer network to strike at targets throughout the city. This repo is a testbed for the "colony management" part of the game.
